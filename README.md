# 32-bit-5-Stage-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This project implements a 32-bit, 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor using Verilog HDL, based on the RV32I instruction set. It supports instruction-level parallelism with hazard detection, data forwarding, and modular design. Core functionality is verified using ModelSim simulation.

For complete details, see the attached project report.
